# FLUTTER DESKTOP APP

This is a desktop app on flutter, consuming the services offered by github.

## Getting Started

This is an example of a flutter desktop app, based on the codelab: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-github-client.

In order to run the project, the "Github Client ID" and "Github Client Secret" are required.

Once you have that information, copy inside the file "lib/app/utils/credential.dart"
